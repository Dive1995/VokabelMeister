# **App Name**: VokabelMeister

## Core Features:

- Vocabulary Selection: Allow users to input the number of words they want to learn, their proficiency level (A1-C2), categories of words, or paste a list of new comma separated words.
- AI-Powered Content Generation: For each word, generate its meaning, a context sentence, and a mnemonic to help remember it, acting as a tool. When generating content for each new word, words already known should be included as part of the tool to help reduce duplication.
- Word Status Tracking: Allow users to mark each word as 'Already Know' or 'Learn this word'.
- Interactive Vocabulary Games: Offer a selection of vocabulary games including a typing race, memory card game, quick-fire rounds, and word puzzles/crosswords.
- Spaced Repetition System: Implement a spaced repetition algorithm to schedule review of words based on user performance. When playing games, we select the new words user wants to learn, also words that he has already learned relevant now based on spaced repetition algorithm.
